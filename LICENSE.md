TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
   a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
   under the terms of this General Public License.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
   and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
   and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
   this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
   recipients of the Program a copy of this License.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that
   you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
   that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
   or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
   to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the
   terms of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
   1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
   code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
   above.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
   as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void.

5. This License will automatically terminate if you fail to comply with
   the terms and conditions stated herein.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
   these terms and conditions.
